"""
A card change must not recompute the cells it did not change.

kwdagger identifies a node by hashing its own configuration, so an unchanged
node keeps its id when a different part of the card changes. Rooting the DAG
under a hash of the whole card threw that away and recomputed everything.

The card, its pipeline and the program the pipeline runs are all built in
``tmp_path``, so these tests do not depend on any shipped card.
