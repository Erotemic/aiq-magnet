"""
kwdagger nodes that lease their own inference endpoints.

Wrapping a whole evaluation in one lease holds every model in the cohort for
the entire run, including while the analysis nodes that need no model at all
are running. Here the lease is a property of the node: it declares which of its
parameters name endpoints, and its command renders as::

    infer-stack run --endpoint <alias> ... -- <the original command>

so an endpoint is held for the jobs that use it and no longer. Concurrency
becomes infer-stack's problem -- kwdagger may have eight jobs in flight and
infer-stack coalesces the ones wanting the same model -- and switching from a
simulator to a real GPU is `INFER_STACK_CATALOG`, not a code change.

The cost: with ``reclaim: stop`` a cohort with more models than GPUs reloads
weights repeatedly. Use ``reclaim: keep-warm``, where the lease bounds
entitlement rather than container lifetime.

Under Slurm the rendered command also carries an allow-list of the GPUs the
job was actually given, since infer-stack otherwise plans against every card
it can see -- which on a host without a device cgroup is all of them, not the
ones this job was allocated. See :data:`GPU_ALLOW_LIST_EXPANSION`.

Opt-in via ``MAGNET_PER_NODE_LEASING=1``. Off by default because plenty of
legitimate runs point at a server infer-stack does not manage.

#: neither variable is set the whole thing is an empty unquoted expansion,
#: which a shell drops from the argument list -- as opposed to
#: ``--allowed_gpus ''``, which infer-stack would see and have to interpret.
#: The odd two-part shape is what makes ``SLURM_STEP_GPUS`` a fallback rather
#: than a second flag: the first half contributes only the flag name when
#: ``SLURM_JOB_GPUS`` is set, and the second half supplies either that
#: variable's value or, only if it is unset, the step's.
#:
#: ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` is deliberately not in the chain. It may
#: legitimately hold GPU UUIDs (``GPU-4d888104-...``) instead of indices, and
#: infer-stack parses this value with ``int()`` per element, so a UUID there is
#: a crash rather than a narrower allow-list. The two SLURM_* variables are

    outside the container. Both layers are independently inert until asked
    for.

            released when the command ends. Sized generously on purpose: a
            TTL that expires mid-job would let another lease reclaim the GPU
            out from under it.
        lease_timeout (str | int | None): how long to wait for readiness.
            Must exceed a cold model load, which for a large model on a cold
            HF cache is minutes, not seconds.
        lease_queue (bool): wait for capacity instead of failing when the
            GPUs are busy. On by default -- with a DAG scheduling more jobs
            than the box has GPUs, "busy" is the normal case, not an error.
